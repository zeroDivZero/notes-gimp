# EXPORT

## File &rarr; Export As

Specify new file name. If filetype extension included (e.g., `.jpg`), GIMP automatically exports in that format.

On image quality dialog, check "Show preview in image window" checkbox, image on canvas will update to reflect quality value. This also enables "file size" info.
